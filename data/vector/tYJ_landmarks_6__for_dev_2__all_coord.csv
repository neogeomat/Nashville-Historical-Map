In the early 1820s, he built a two-story, brick, Federal-style home and named it Belle Meade, a hybrid French-English term meaning ""beautiful meadow"". His son William Giles Harding (1808–1886) took over the plantation in 1839 and in 1854 transformed the older house into a much larger Greek Revival mansion. A two-story addition, connected to the main structure by a breezeway, was added to the right side of the house. A portico and a pediment were added to the facade. Chimneys were built on each end of the main structure, an attic was added, and the exterior was stuccoed.
Records show that just before the Civil War, Harding used 136 slaves to run the farm. He was a supporter of the Confederacy and a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia. When Union troops occupied Nashville, he was arrested and sent to Fort Mackinac for six months before being released. When slavery ended, about half of the former slaves chose to become employees of the farm.
In 1868 Harding's daughter Selene (1846–1892) married William Hicks Jackson (1835–1903), who began to share the management of the farm with Harding. They expanded breeding operations, raising cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. In the 1880s Jackson added hot and cold running water, bathrooms, and a telephone to the mansion. The Panic of 1893 and efforts by churches to curtail horse racing and the associated gambling hurt the business of the farm, and the family was forced to sell off acreage. 
After Jackson's death in 1903, the family sold the mansion and the remaining property. The Belle Meade Land Company bought the bulk of the farm, developing it into the suburb of Belle Meade. The state of Tennessee purchased the last 24 acres, including the mansion, in 1953 and turned it over to the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities. It is now a museum, restaurant, and winery.","3560","-6871","6871",,"yes","belle-meade-mansion-1955.png","1955","photo","TSLA",,"1928 or later, author and copyright uncertain","https://tnsos.org/tsla/imagesearch/citation.php?ImageID=19216","yes","belle-meade-mansion-1970.png","1970","photo","TSLA",,"1928 or later, author and copyright uncertain","https://tnsos.org/tsla/imagesearch/citation.php?ImageID=27148","36.103354","-86.864291","37.18","30.63"

Franklin had amassed a huge fortune as a slave trader, but at Adelicia's request he gave up the slave trade and became a planter when they wed. Franklin passed away in 1846, leaving his fortune, which included several plantations in other states, to his wife and making her possibly the richest woman in the US. 
In 1849 Adelicia remarried, choosing Joseph Acklen (1816–1863), the US attorney for the North Alabama district. The couple began building Belmont soon after their wedding in May, 1849, with construction lasting three years. The house was the centerpiece of a 177-acre estate that featured it own gas lighting system, gardens, a greenhouse, a conservatory, a zoo, an art gallery, a lake, an aviary, a bowling alley, and a billiard parlor.
When Union troops took possession of Nashville in 1862, Joseph left for the family's plantations in Louisiana while Adelicia stayed behind in Nashville. 2800 bales of cotton, worth nearly a million dollars and representing much of the family's remaining assets, had accumulated on the plantation and could not be sold. Both Union and Confederate armies were operating in the area of the plantation, and both sides would have rather burned the cotton than risk the other side benefiting from it. 
In September 1863 Joseph died at the plantation. On January 1st Adelicia left for Louisiana with Sarah Carter, a cousin. On arrival they learned that Confederate General Leonidas Polk had ordered the burning of the cotton. Sarah made the 150-mile trip to Polk's headquarters and managed to persuade the general, an acquaintance of Adelicia's, to rescind his order but also secured Confederate protection and assistance in hauling the cotton to the Mississippi River. The river, however, was controlled by Union gunboats. Adelicia then located Admiral David Porter and improbably negotiated the use of a Union gunboat to carry the cotton to New Orleans, and from there a blockade runner was able to get the cotton to Liverpool, England. 
Later the same year (1864) a Confederate army under General John Bell Hood attacked Franklin, Tennessee before advancing on Nashville in December. Arriving at the beginning of the month, Hood's army dug in as best they could and waited for the order to attack. Union forces had had nearly three years to create a ring of forts and earthworks around the city, and Belmont mansion was just outside of the Union defensive perimeter. During the two-week standoff and the battle that followed, Belmont was the headquarters of Union General George Thomas and a campsite for 13,000 Union soldiers. The fighting took place to the south of the mansion, and little damage was done to the house during the battle, though the grounds and some outbuildings were damaged.
After the war Adelicia married a third time, this time to Dr. William Cheatham. Over the years that followed Adelicia sold off her plantations and, in an apparent separation from Cheatham, departed Nashville in 1884 with three of her grown children. In January 1887, shortly begore her death and while living in Washington DC, Adelicia sold Belmont to Lewis Baxter, a developer. Two years later Baxter sold part of the estate, including the mansion, to schoolteachers Ida Hood and Susan Heron, who opened Belmont Women's College in 1890. The school subsequently underwent several name changes, becoming Ward–Belmont College in 1913, Belmont College in 1951, and Belmont University in 1991.","4824","-6165","6165",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36.136880","-86.79477","50.06","37.86"

The 1855 complex was designed by Adolphus Heiman (1809–1862) and continued the pattern of having a long, low section of market stalls bookended by two taller buildings mostly devoted to public purposes. The two-story buildings at each end were enlarged to three stories, each bearing two square cupolas. The first floor of both buildings may have been devoted to revenue-raising commercial space. The second floor of the south end held the offices of various city officials and departments: the mayor, the auditor, tax collectors, the treasurer, the city recorder, and the police department. The third floor was a courtroom. The north end housed assembly rooms for city councilmen on the second floor and meeting space for a fraternal organization, the Improved Order of Red Men, on the third.
The market stalls, also called the City Market or the Market House, are the direct ancestors of today's farmer's market. One key difference is that in addition to meat and produce, until 1864 human beings were sometimes sold there.
On the night of January 2nd, 1897, a fire broke out in Lebeck Brothers' dry goods store and spread to several nearby buildings before it could be extinguished. The south end of the city hall-market house complex, containing city offices, caught fire. A fire crew trying to access water in a cistern adjacent to city hall found that the cistern had been paved over. A crowd watching the proceedings chanted ""Let it burn!"", due either to their animosity toward city government or their disgust at the dilapidated state of the building. The south end was badly damaged and was replaced by a grander city hall the following year; the north end was undamaged.","5114","-5452","5452",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36.168475","-86.778784","53.00","45.14"

Over the next year, a larger city hall building with a single tower was built and was occupied in March 1898.

City Market, 1870
Strange to say, Nashville has but one General Market-house, and, if we may be allowed the suggestion, would intimate a very inferior one at that. Instead of well-appointed marketplaces, distributed at convenient intervals throughout the City, like most of her rival sisters, the people of Nashville, from all quarters of the town, are compelled to resort to this mart for their supplies. However, in the absence of anything better arranged, or more attractive, as to appearanees, the place is liberally patronized, and its business necessarily gives employment to hurnlrcds of persons. A portion of the markethouse, as we understaud, was built about the year 1827 or '28. In 1855 it was enlarged and remodelled, and the addition of the City Hall made to it; but the work, as intended, was never fully carried out, as it was proposed to build a public hall, extending over the entire marketplace, and accessible from both the north and south ends. The present value of the markethouse is about $55,000. It is ___ feet long and ___ feet wide, and contains 100 stalls. These stalls are a source of considerable revenue to the city, and yield about $45,000 per annum.

City Hall. 1870
Although occupying the upper portion of the markethouse building, yet, our city hall is worthy of separate attention. If the design of the architect had been fully carried out, when the addition of the city hall was made to the markethouse, in 1855, it would have been, no doubt, much more attractive and convenient than at present. The public hall, as before stated, would have been immediately over the marketplace, and the present city hall, or halls, used only as office rooms for municipal dignitaries. As it is, they have no direct connection, and in reality, might be considered two buildings – being built, as they are, over the extreme ends of the building. They are each three stories high, and are surmounted each by two cupolas; one at every corner. The cupola at the southeast corner contains the central fire alarm bell, which is connected with the Eclipse Steam Engine Honse, adjoining. The second story of the south end is divided up into offices for the mayor, city auditor, city tax collectors, city treasurer, water tax collector, superintendent of the waterworks, city recorder, and police headquarters. The third story of the building is the recorder's, or city police, courtroom. The north end of the city hall is of similar size as the other, but in the interior is differently constructed. It has but one stairway, which leads up from the northwest corner. The second story is occupied entirely, save the stairway lobby, by the assembly rooms of the Board of Aldermen and Councilmen. The third story is occupied by an organization known as the Improved Order of Red Men, as a council chamber or ""wigwam"".

City Hall, 1880
That venerable establishment, which serves the City of Nashville the double purpose of City Hall and Market House, is among the oldest"" and most unsightly of all our public institutions, A portion of the building was erected in 1827 or 1828. In 1855, it was remodeled and enlarged, and the addition of the city hall made to it; but the work, as intended, was never fully carried out, as it was proposed to build a public hall, extending over the entire market-place, and accessible from both the north and south ends. Some years ago an effort was made to remove this building, but the projectors were met by the stubborn fact that the General Assembly of North Carolina, in 1784, reserved four acres (the present Public Square) for public buildings, and the question has never been settled, whether the city could divert the space to other purposes. The writer is not a prophet, but he dares prophesy that ten years from now the demands of progressive civilization will have removed the market-place, and on the present site thereof, a· superb and creditable City Hall will be erected. Furthermore, that the ""Public Square"" ""will lose its primitive nomenclature, and be· known to the next generation as ""City Hall Square,"" or ""Court Square."" The present building cost $55,000, .and on the first floor has 100 stalls. The upper stories contain the council chambers, and the offices of the municipal authorities.

City Hall, 1897
Nashville's City Hall, imposing three-story brick and stone building with tower, located on Public Square, completed. Planned since January 1896, when fire almost destroyed old building, construction progressed steadily during the past year. George Stainback, Bennet H. Beazley, and William T. Smith, recently elected chairman, Board of Public Works and Affairs, supervised construction. Mayor R.H. Dudley, members of Board of Public Works, and other officials occupy offices on second floor of City Hall, with first floor rental property and City Council Chambers on third floor.

1897 Fire
FIRE IN NASHVILLE. LARGE BUSINESS BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED LAST NIGHT. Flames That Started in a Dry Goods Store Burned Over an Area of a Block and a Half.

Nashville, Tenn., January 3d, 12:30 a. m. —Lebeck Brothers, wholesale and retail dry goods; Grimes, Daily and Robinson, dry goods dealers, and the public market, having an area of a block and a half, have been totally destroyed by fire, which started about 11 o’clock. The fire started in Lebeck Brothers’. Lebeck’s insurance is $100,000. It is impossible to give others in detail, but insurance men approximate it at $700,000. The falling of the south wall of the Burns building did more to check the flames than anything else, completely burying in brick and mortar the small houses, and making a gap that the fire could not jump on Market street where it looked as though by the aid of the wind a tremendous conflagration was in progress. Crushing walls and showers of flaming sparks added terror to the occasion. The marvellous thing about the disaster is that no fatalities occurred. Lebeck Brothers, in whose building the fire started, are extensive wholesale and retail dry goods merchants. The fire originated in the second story of Lebeck Brothers and spread westward. At 12:30 A. M. a terrific wind arose from the southwest which fanned the flames into a fury. The City Hall and market, which is located opposite the ruined buildings, caught from sparks and was very seriously damaged. Burns & Co., harness manufacturers, located on Market street in the rear of Lebeck Bros., caught at 12:15 and was totally ruined. The total loss at this hour is estimated at $1,000,000. Telegrams have been sent to Louisville, Memphis and Chattanooga for help and the tire has little signs of abatement. At 1:05 o’clock tlie rear walls of the Burns saddlery store fell through the jewelry store of B. H. Stenf & Co., crushing a number of people. Charles Thompson is the only one reported seriously injured.","yes","city-hall-and-market-house-2nd-ca1905.jpg","ca 1905","photo","NPLSC",,"before 1928","https://cdm15769.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/nr/id/7759/rec/2",,,,,,,,,"36.168251","-86.778618","53.03","45.09"

The fort was a cross-shaped blockhouse with earthen parapets on three sides that contained artillery. 
The elevation that made the hill a desirable location for a fort also made it a good location for the city's third reservoir, replacing the reservoir on Rolling Mill Hill. Construction of the reservoir began in 1886 and took three years to complete, obscuring all traces of the old fort. The walls are 34-feet high and can hold as much as 51 million gallons of water in two separate basins. Water was pumped from the Cumberland River into the western half of the reservoir, and silt was allowed to settle. The silt-free water then flowed into the eastern half, and from there was distributed to consumers.
A little after midnight on November 5th, 1912, the same day Woodrow Wilson was elected president, a segment of the reservoir's southeastern wall gave way. Years of slow seepage had undermined a section of wall on the reservoir's southeastern side. Millions of gallons of water cascaded down the hill, pushing away tons of earth and rock fill and scouring a portion of the hill down to the bedrock. Houses were washed off their foundations, and people floated out of their houses still in their beds. Remarkably, no one was killed in the disaster. The repaired section of the reservoir wall, about 175 feet in length, can still be distinguished today.","5080","-6085","6085",,"yes","city-reservoir-1912.jpg","1912","photo","TSLA Files",,"before 1928","https://sharetngov.tnsosfiles.com/tsla/exhibits/disasters/images/floods/3456.jpg (2)",,,,,,,,,"36.140344","-86.780638","52.67","38.68"

About 10 years later he built a brick house a little to the north of the log house. In the 1830s the log home was enlarged, covered in clapboard and eventually named Evergreen Place.

A stone church was built on Craighead's land and was used not just for his services but also as a school, Davidson Academy. The academy moved into the city in 1806, and was first renamed Cumberland College and later the University of Nashville. In 1875 the University of Nashville was broken into Peabody University, Montgomery Bell Academy, and the Vanderbilt Medical and Dental Departments, all of which can trace their ancestry back to this patch of land in Inglewood.

He had by 1828 brought most of the congregation around to the new doctrine, and in that year a resolution was adopted nullifying the church's previous constitution and rules of order. Thus, the Baptist Church of Nashville became Spring Street Christian Church. 
The opponents of Campbellism initially remained with the church but in 1830 left to form the First Baptist Church of Nashville. By 1841 they had built a Gothic Revival church on 5th Avenue North (pictured above), which served the congregation until it moved to Broad Street in 1886.

The most impressive structure, Fort Negley, went to St. Cloud Hill.
Nashville, the logistics hub for US military operations west of the Appalachians, was critical to the Union effort and so became the most heavily fortified city in the country apart from Washington DC. Fort Negley, the biggest inland stone fortification constructed during the war, was a symbol of the importance attached to Nashville.
Approximately 2700 laborers, mainly runaway slaves, built Fort Negley between September and December 1862. A quarter of the workers died during construction due to the harsh conditions. Fort Negley's artillery was used during the Battle of Nashville in 1864, but otherwise the fort played no role in the battle. 
Initially named for General James S. Negley (1826–1901), the fort was renamed Fort Harker in 1865 due to General Negley's questionable performance at the Battle of Chickamauga, but the new name never took hold. 
The US Army abandoned the fort in September 1867, and after the army departed, the hill resumed its role as a popular picnic spot for Nashvillians. During Reconstruction the fort was also the site of Ku Klux Klan meetings.
By the 1930s the fort had deteriorated badly. The Works Progress Adminstration (WPA) financed the restoration of the fort, which reopened in 1938. After the WPA restoration, little effort was made at further upkeep and the fort again decayed. The WPA's replica stockade was torn down in the 1960s, and the fort was closed to the public. Beginning in 2002 the fort was again restored, this time by the City of Nashville, and reopened to the public in 2004.","5193","-5953","5953",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36.146172","-86.774404","53.82","40.03"

They lived in a two-story blockhouse built by the previous owner to resist Indian attacks. Jackson began farming  at the Hermitage with nine slaves, a number that grew to 110 by the time of his death in 1845. 
In 1819 the Jacksons began building a grander, two-story Federal-style residence in a location on the property chosen by Rachel. The blocks for the limestone foundation were quarried on the plantation, and the bricks were made on-site from clay dug out of a nearby field. In 1831, after Rachel's death and during Jackson's first presidential term, the house was enlarged by adding one-story wings to each side of the original structure and a one-story portico with 10 columns. A chimney fire three years later did severe damage to the house, gutting the interior. For the rebuilt Hermitage, Jackson chose to replicate the 1831 structure but added a two-story Greek revival style portico to its front. It was finished in 1836, shortly before the end of his second term.
When Jackson died in 1845, his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr. (1808–1865), inherited the plantation, but financial reversals forced him to sell it to the State of Tennessee in 1856. Over the next 33 years, a number of uses were considered for the property, including a southern branch of the West Point military academy. Finally, in 1889 the state handed the house and 25 acres over to the Ladies' Hermitage Association, a group founded to preserve the  house and grounds.","8072","-4377","4377",,"yes","hermitage-1967.png","1967","photo","TSLA",,"author and copyright uncertain","https://tnsos.org/tsla/imagesearch/citation.php?ImageID=19369",,,,,,,,,"36.215200","-86.615507","83.15","56.17"

Named for the second superintendent of Nashville public schools, James L. Meigs (ca. 1827–1891), it was designed to hold grades 1 through 8. In the mid 1880s, the failure of the city to provide any schooling for Black children beyond the 8th grade spurred a campaign for a new high school. Parents showed up at the all-white high school asking that their children be enrolled but were turned away. Meetings were held and parents petitioned the school board for a high school for their children. Responding to pressure, in 1886 the school board set aside the second floor of the newly built Meigs school as the first African-American high school in Nashville. In March 1933 Meigs School was destroyed by a tornado.

Its president, Philip Lindsley (1786–1855), resigned the same year. At about the same time and possibly related to the closure of the school, 3rd Avenue South was extended and the main building of the university, Cumberland Hall, which had stood directily in the path of the street, was demolished. 
In preparation for the reopening of the school, a new building, called the Stone Building and later the Chapel Building, was erected in 1853 on a 30-acre plot two blocks south of the old campus. Prior to that time the only building on the land had been the chancellor's residence. The following year the university's merger with the Western Military Institute necessitated a dormitory to house the students, so the building pictured above was built. This dormitory was called Lindsley Hall during its existence, but at some point in the early 20th century it was razed and the Chapel Building took the name Lindsley Hall.","5318","-5728","5728",,"yes","old-lindsley-hall.jpg",,"photo","TeVA",,"date, copyright and author uncertain, appears to be before 1928","https://tnsos.org/tsla/imagesearch/citation.php?ImageID=27976",,,,,,,,,"36.156130","-86.767511","55.09","42.33"

The downtown location worked well at a time when most mail moved by rail, but by the 1980s it was inefficient.

The world's only full-size replica of the Greek Parthenon was created for the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition as the physical expression of the nickname. Intended to last only as long as the fair, the building's exterior surfaces were made of plaster. Once the decision was made not to demolish the building at the end of the exposition, maintenance of the deteriorating plaster became an ongoing problem. Finally, in 1920 reconstruction of the building began, using reinforced concrete for the load-bearing structure and cast concrete aggregate for the exterior surfaces. The 1897 interior had been designed as a gallery space and so was not historically accurate, but the rebuilt Parthenon was designed to be an accurate replica inside and out. Exterior work was completed in 1925; the interior was completed in 1931. One missing element was the statue of Athena Parthenos that dominated the interior of the ancient Greek Parthenon. A donation box sat inside the Parthenon for many years, and by the early 1980s the fund had grown large enough for work on Athena to begin. Sculptor Alan Lequire (1955–) was selected to do the work, and the 42-foot, 12-ton cement Athena was unveiled in 1990. Further donations paid for the statue to be painted and gilded, work that was completed in 2002.

Murphy (?–1900), who had made his fortune selling whiskey, bought two parcels of land bounded by Church Street, Patterson Street, 20th Avenue and 21st Avenue. He built an Italianate mansion on his tree-covered estate, where he lived until his death in 1900. In 1911 Buford College bought the property from Murphy's heirs and constructed a large brick building with two wings, the West Building, to serve as a school building. Buford College adopted the name Nashville College for Young Women (NCYW) around this time. 
Things must not have gone to plan for NCYW because the school lost the property to foreclosure. The promoters of a new hospital, Protestant Hospital, purchased the 10-acre plot in November 1918, with the hospital opening in March 1919. The mansion was used as a dormitory for the school of nursing, while the hospital filled the West Building. The hospital endured repeated financial difficulties during the first three decades of its existence, leading to the Tennessee Baptist Convention assuming control in 1948. At that time the hospital took the name Mid-State Baptist Hospital, changing it again to Baptist Hospital in 1964. In 1967 the West Building was razed to make space for a new 300-bed wing of the hospital.","4685","-5747","5747","https://www.newspapers.com/image/111992436/

The Hospital opened on March 22, 1919, on Church Street near 20th Avenue on an old homestead of Samuel Murphy. The institution was planned by the Ministers' Alliance of Nashville and in 1924 had a bed capacity of 210. During the Depression, this Hospital merged with Baptist Hospital which then operated a hospital at Eighth Avenue and Union Street. The merged hospital went into receivership during the Depression but emerged as the modern day Baptist Hospital campus after World War II. 

The original 80-bed hospital consisted of the Murphy house, with two three-story additions. In 1924, a new building was constructed, expanding the hospital’s bedcount to 210. In 1948, Protestant Hospital became Mid-State Baptist Hospital and was placed under the control of the Tennessee Baptist Convention. 
Protestant Hospital opened 1919 in two buildings on a 10-acre block on Church Street. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36.155514","-86.802459","48.63","42.12"

Ryman and Jones intended the auditorium to be primarily a venue for religious revivals, especially Jones's, but it hosted other types of events from the beginning. At first there was no balcony – the balcony was added in 1897 to accommodate a reunion of Confederate veterans that coincided with the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. There was also no stage, just a pulpit and a small platform. In 1901 the stage was added to facilitate a performance of ""The Barber of Seville"" by the Metropolitan Opera. The Grand Ole Opry moved to the auditorium in 1943 and stayed for 30 years before leaving for suburban Pennington Bend. After the Opry's planned move was made public, the owner, radio station WSM, announced its intention to demolish the building.

William Strickland (1788–1854) of Philadelphia designed the building, and construction lasted from 1845 to 1859. Slave, convict and commercial labor were all used in construction. 
Strickland chose to top the structure with a replica of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, making Tennessee's capitol one of 13 state capitols without a dome.

In 1885 Nashville acquired its first professional baseball team, and the city built a grandstand in the same field. In 1894 an exhibition game between the Nashville Tigers and the New Orleans Pelicans was played at night, the first ever night baseball game in Nashville. In 1890 the ballpark was renamed AthletIc Park. In 1908 sportswriter Grantland Rice (1880–1954) began referring to it as Sulphur Springs Dell, which he later shortened to Sulphur Dell, and that name was eventually adopted by the ballpark. 

Numerous additions and improvements were made to the facility over the years, but one problem persisted. The grandstands had been built along the north and east sides of the park and home plate faced southwest. This orientation forced batters to look into the afternoon sun. At the conclusion of the 1926 season, the ballpark was demolished and rotated 180°, allowing batters to stand with their backs to the sun. This new layout exposed a steep incline, especially in right field, that had formerly been covered by the bleachers and the grandstand. Thereafter right fielders playing in Sulphur Dell were nicknamed mountain goats. The lighting was upgraded in 1931, allowing the first non-exhibition night games to be played at the field.

Teams that played at Sulphur Dell include:

•  Nashville Americans (1885–1886)
•  Nashville Blues (1887)
•  Nashville Tigers (1893–1894)
•  Nashville Seraphs (1895)
•  Nashville Centennials (1897)

The railroads were competitors before, during, and after the Civil War, but in 1880 the L&N executed a hostile acquisition of the NC&StL. Anger in Nashville at the takeover of the hometown NC&StL was sufficient that the L&N let its new acquisition continue as an independent subsidiary for the next 77 years. 
By the 1880s both railroads were outgrowing their depots in Nashville. In 1898 the city of Nashville, the NC&StL and the L&N entered into an agreement that allowed the railroads to build a new depot at Broadway and 10th Avenue. Called Union Station because it was used by two railroads and so, in a sense, represented the union of their rail networks, the new train station opened in 1900. The NC&StL and the L&N used their clout to prevent the upstart Tennessee Central from using Union Station. The Tennessee Central made do with a separate depot near the foot of the Shelby Street Bridge.
In 1955 freight traffic was moved to Radnor Yards, and two years later the NC&StL and L&N officially merged, closing the NC&StL offices in Nashville. Passenger trains between Florida and Chicago, one each way per day, continued to use the depot until 1979, when 120 years of passenger rail ended in Nashville.

Over the years the building was home to the Nashville Electric Service, Flagg Brothers Shoe Store, Joy's Flowers, an HG Hill grocery, Joseph Morse & Co., and Mills Bookstore. The Watkins Institute Building was razed in 1956 and replaced two years later by the WT Grant Building, with the Watkins Institute occupying the 2nd and 3rd floors. The Nashville Public Library now occupies the site.","5065","-5561","5561","southwest corner of 6th Avenue and Church Street",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36.163646","-86.781485","52.50","44.03"

Warioto Cotton Mills bought the property in 1905 and sold it two years later to Morgan and Hamilton, who kept the Warioto name into the 1920s. The factory was known as Warioto Mills during this period. In 1925 Morgan and Hamilton/Warioto Mills was the second-largest manufacturer of cotton bags in the country. In 1928 Morgan and Hamilton merged with the Werthan Bag Company, with the combined company taking the Werthan name and using the 8th Avenue North complex. By 1998 manufacturing activity had moved to 5th Avenue North, and in 2010 the business moved again to White House, Tennessee. Meanwhile, the old factory buildings on 8th Avenue North were converted into condos and retail space.","4837","-5183","5183",,"yes","werthan-mills-1875.jpg","1875","illustration","Metro Archives",,"before 1928","http://nashvillearchives.org/business-photos.html#prettyPhoto",,,,,,,,,"36.180534","-86.794087","50.17","47.88"
