Lawrence intersected with Broadway at what is now 10th Avenue South beside the Frist Museum.

Sometime after 1904 ""13th Avenue"" was also applied to several streets in Edgehill, so that today 13th Avenue consists of four discontinuous residential streets in that neighborhood and a small length of frontage road south of Broadway.

To the right was Buena Vista Pike, leading to Buena Vista Ferry, and once across the river, to destinations such as Clarksville and Springfield. To the left lay Hydes Ferry Pike and Hydes Ferry, a direct route to points along the Cumberland such as Ashland City.

Buena Vista Pike began at the modern intersection of 9th Avenue, Garfield Street and Buchanan Street  (in front of Jones School), proceeded up Buchanan Street and crossed the Cumberland at Buena Vista Ferry. 
Starting about 1861 and for some years afterward there was a pest house (short for ""pestilence house"") adjacent to the ferry on the west side of the turnpike. Pestilence houses were used to separate the contagious from the rest of the citizenry, sometimes forcibly. The pest house was located toward the back of what is now a parking lot for RiverView Business Center in Metro Center, near the levee. 
North of the river, Buena Vista Pike traveled north-northwest until it intersected with Whites Creek Pike just south of the Whites Creek community.  ",4415,4386,45.825,56.08

73,Charlotte,Pike,Charlotte Road,"Named after the town of Charlotte in Dickson County, the end point of the turnpike. The town of Charlotte was in turn named for Charlotte Reeves Robertson (1751-1843) who, along with her husband James Robertson, was one of the first European-American settlers of Nashville.
Hydes Ferry Pike is the only example of one of Nashville's major radial pikes having been functionally replaced by a modern road, in its case Ashland City Highway, but about 3/4 of the old Charlotte Pike has met the same fate, leaving the western end of the modern Charlotte Pike nowhere near the hamlet of Charlotte.
Driving west from downtown, Modern Charlotte Avenue and Charlotte Pike largely follow the old pike, but the original took a hard right turn at Old Charlotte Pike. Just before leaving the county, the old turnpike took another right turn, leaving the road now known as Old Charlotte Pike and following Gourley Road. In Cheatham County it more or less followed the modern Gourley Road, Old Charlotte Pike (a distinct road from the Old Charlotte Pike in Davidson County), a short abandoned segment, Dog Creek Road, and Highway 70. 
It entered Dickson County on Highway 70, then approximately followed Old Charlotte Road, Highway 47 and Old Highway 47 before finally reaching the town of Charlotte.

The water from the spring could be chaneled into Fort Nashborough in case of a siege by native Americans. 
The name of the street was officially changed in 1866. The churches lining the street in the 1870s include First Presbyterian Church, McKendree Methodist Church, Christ Episcopal Church and Central Baptist Church.
Spring Street was one of just two east-west streets in Thomas Molloy's plan of Nashville, the other being Cedar Street, or modern Charlotte Avenue. Prior to the 1870s, Church Street (via Elliston Place) was the urban extension of Richland Pike, or modern Harding Pike.",4920,5635,50.99,43.339

77,Clarksville,Pike,"New Bridge Road, Hydes Ferry Pike","Clarksville Pike is possibly the newest road to be called a ""pike"" in Davidson County and was never a pike in the toll-charging sense. The road itself was built mainly in two stages, in the 1880s and 1930s, and the name seems not to have been used much before the 1940s. 
The critical first step in the creation of Clarksville Pike was the building of the Bordeaux Bridge in 1891, which rearranged the geography of North Nashville. In a stroke it made the two ferries in the area, Hydes Ferry and Buena Vista Ferry, obsolete and reduced the importance of the approaches to the ferries, Hydes Ferry Pike and Buena Vista Pike. 
The new bridge required new access roads. On the south side of the river, New Bridge Road was built, connecting to Beck Spring Road, now 26th Avenue, and from there to Hydes Ferry Pike. On the north side, two new roads were needed. One, now John Mallette Drive, angled slightly to the west to connect with Hydes Ferry Pike. The other, called New Bridge Road, made a hard right turn after leaving the bridge and eventually connected to Buena Vista Pike via Whites Creek Road. Neither was called Clarksville Pike.
In the 1930s a new highway to Clarksville was built that bypassed the old pikes. This new road, along with the  piece of New Bridge Road south of the river was, with impeccable analogous logic (Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Frankiln Pike), was designated ""Clarksville Pike"".",4329,4960,44.95,50.221

In the 20th century this pike suffered the triple indignity of having its western end renamed (Vultee Boulevard), having a large section obliterated by the airport, and being partly drowned by Percy Priest Lake.
