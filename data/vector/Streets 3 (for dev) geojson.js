The road itself was built mainly in two stages, in the 1880s and 1930s, and the name seems not to have been used much before the 1940s. \nThe critical first step in the creation of Clarksville Pike was the building of the Bordeaux Bridge in 1891, which rearranged the geography of North Nashville. In a stroke it made the two ferries in the area, Hydes Ferry and Buena Vista Ferry, obsolete and reduced the importance of the approaches to the ferries, Hydes Ferry Pike and Buena Vista Pike. \nThe new bridge required new access roads. On the south side of the river, New Bridge Road was built, connecting to Beck Spring Road, now 26th Avenue, and from there to Hydes Ferry Pike. On the north side, two new roads were needed. One, now John Mallette Drive, angled slightly to the west to connect with Hydes Ferry Pike. The other, called New Bridge Road, made a hard right turn after leaving the bridge and eventually connected to Buena Vista Pike via Whites Creek Road. Neither was called Clarksville Pike.\nIn the 1930s a new highway to Clarksville was built that bypassed the old pikes. This new road, along with the  piece of New Bridge Road south of the river was, with impeccable analogous logic (Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Frankiln Pike), was designated \"Clarksville Pike\".", "X Location": "4329", "Y Location": "4960", "field_7": null, "field_8": null, "field_9": null, "field_10": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 44.949673878119796, 50.220904555768982 ] } },
