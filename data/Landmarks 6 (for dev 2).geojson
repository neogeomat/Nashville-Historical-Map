In the early 1820s, he built a two-story, brick, Federal-style home and named it Belle Meade, a hybrid French-English term meaning 'beautiful meadow'. His son William Giles Harding (1808–1886) took over the plantation in 1839 and in 1854 transformed the older house into a much larger Greek Revival mansion. A two-story addition, connected to the main structure by a breezeway, was added to the right side of the house. A portico and a pediment were added to the facade. Chimneys were built on each end of the main structure, an attic was added, and the exterior was stuccoed.\nRecords show that just before the Civil War, Harding used 136 slaves to run the farm. He was a supporter of the Confederacy and a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia. When Union troops occupied Nashville, he was arrested and sent to Fort Mackinac for six months before being released. When slavery ended, about half of the former slaves chose to become employees of the farm.\nIn 1868 Harding's daughter Selene (1846–1892) married William Hicks Jackson (1835–1903), who began to share the management of the farm with Harding. They expanded breeding operations, raising cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. In the 1880s Jackson added hot and cold running water, bathrooms, and a telephone to the mansion. The Panic of 1893 and efforts by churches to curtail horse racing and the associated gambling hurt the business of the farm, and the family was forced to sell off acreage. \nAfter Jackson's death in 1903, the family sold the mansion and the remaining property. The Belle Meade Land Company bought the bulk of the farm, developing it into the suburb of Belle Meade. The state of Tennessee purchased the last 24 acres, including the mansion, in 1953 and turned it over to the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities. It is now a museum, restaurant, and winery." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 37.179767034894482, 30.635447332068495 ] } },

Franklin had amassed a huge fortune as a slave trader, but at Adelicia's request he gave up the slave trade and became a planter when they wed. Franklin passed away in 1846, leaving his fortune, which included several plantations in other states, to his wife and making her possibly the richest woman in the US. \nIn 1849 Adelicia remarried, choosing Joseph Acklen (1816–1863), the US attorney for the North Alabama district. The couple began building Belmont soon after their wedding in May, 1849, with construction lasting three years. The house was the centerpiece of a 177-acre estate that featured it own gas lighting system, gardens, a greenhouse, a conservatory, a zoo, an art gallery, a lake, an aviary, a bowling alley, and a billiard parlor.\nWhen Union troops took possession of Nashville in 1862, Joseph left for the family's plantations in Louisiana while Adelicia stayed behind in Nashville. 2800 bales of cotton, worth nearly a million dollars and representing much of the family's remaining assets, had accumulated on the plantation and could not be sold. Both Union and Confederate armies were operating in the area of the plantation, and both sides would have rather burned the cotton than risk the other side benefiting from it. \nIn September 1863 Joseph died at the plantation. On January 1st Adelicia left for Louisiana with Sarah Carter, a cousin. On arrival they learned that Confederate General Leonidas Polk had ordered the burning of the cotton. Sarah made the 150-mile trip to Polk's headquarters and managed to persuade the general, an acquaintance of Adelicia's, to rescind his order but also secured Confederate protection and assistance in hauling the cotton to the Mississippi River. The river, however, was controlled by Union gunboats. Adelicia then located Admiral David Porter and improbably negotiated the use of a Union gunboat to carry the cotton to New Orleans, and from there a blockade runner was able to get the cotton to Liverpool, England. \nLater the same year (1864) a Confederate army under General John Bell Hood attacked Franklin, Tennessee before advancing on Nashville in December. Arriving at the beginning of the month, Hood's army dug in as best they could and waited for the order to attack. Union forces had had nearly three years to create a ring of forts and earthworks around the city, and Belmont mansion was just outside of the Union defensive perimeter. During the two-week standoff and the battle that followed, Belmont was the headquarters of Union General George Thomas and a campsite for 13,000 Union soldiers. The fighting took place to the south of the mansion, and little damage was done to the house during the battle, though the grounds and some outbuildings were damaged.\nAfter the war Adelicia married a third time, this time to Dr. William Cheatham. Over the years that followed Adelicia sold off her plantations and, in an apparent separation from Cheatham, departed Nashville in 1884 with three of her grown children. In January 1887, shortly begore her death and while living in Washington DC, Adelicia sold Belmont to Lewis Baxter, a developer.

The 1855 complex was designed by Adolphus Heiman (1809–1862) and continued the pattern of having a long, low section of market stalls bookended by two taller buildings mostly devoted to public purposes. The two-story buildings at each end were enlarged to three stories, each bearing two square cupolas. The first floor of both buildings may have been devoted to revenue-raising commercial space. The second floor of the south end held the offices of various city officials and departments: the mayor, the auditor, tax collectors, the treasurer, the city recorder, and the police department. The third floor was a courtroom. The north end housed assembly rooms for city councilmen on the second floor and meeting space for a fraternal organization, the Improved Order of Red Men, on the third.\nThe market stalls, also called the City Market or the Market House, are the direct ancestors of today's farmer's market. One key difference is that in addition to meat and produce, until 1864 human beings were sometimes sold there.\nOn the night of January 2nd, 1897, a fire broke out in Lebeck Brothers' dry goods store and spread to several nearby buildings before it could be extinguished. The south end of the city hall-market house complex, containing city offices, caught fire. A fire crew trying to access water in a cistern adjacent to city hall found that the cistern had been paved over. A crowd watching the proceedings chanted 'Let it burn!', due either to their animosity toward city government or their disgust at the dilapidated state of the building. The south end was badly damaged and was replaced by a grander city hall the following year; the north end was undamaged." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 53.004282512005133, 45.143576927530169 ] } },

Being 272 feet long and 62 feet wide with a two story structure at each. The rooms at the north end appropriated for use of the city corporation, the south end housed the museum of Dr. Troost. - The National Banner and Nashville Whig, Jan. 20, 1829.\n\nCity Market, 1870\nStrange to say, Nashville has but one General Market-house, and, if we may be allowed the suggestion, would intimate a very inferior one at that. Instead of well-appointed marketplaces, distributed at convenient intervals throughout the City, like most of her rival sisters, the people of Nashville, from all quarters of the town, are compelled to resort to this mart for their supplies. However, in the absence of anything better arranged, or more attractive, as to appearanees, the place is liberally patronized, and its business necessarily gives employment to hurnlrcds of persons. A portion of the markethouse, as we understaud, was built about the year 1827 or '28. In 1855 it was enlarged and remodelled, and the addition of the City Hall made to it; but the work, as intended, was never fully carried out, as it was proposed to build a public hall, extending over the entire marketplace, and accessible from both the north and south ends. The present value of the markethouse is about $55,000. It is ___ feet long and ___ feet wide, and contains 100 stalls. These stalls are a source of considerable revenue to the city, and yield about $45,000 per annum.\n\nCity Hall. 1870\nAlthough occupying the upper portion of the markethouse building, yet, our city hall is worthy of separate attention. If the design of the architect had been fully carried out, when the addition of the city hall was made to the markethouse, in 1855, it would have been, no doubt, much more attractive and convenient than at present. The public hall, as before stated, would have been immediately over the marketplace, and the present city hall, or halls, used only as office rooms for municipal dignitaries. As it is, they have no direct connection, and in reality, might be considered two buildings � being built, as they are, over the extreme ends of the building. They are each three stories high, and are surmounted each by two cupolas; one at every corner. The cupola at the southeast corner contains the central fire alarm bell, which is connected with the Eclipse Steam Engine Honse, adjoining. The second story of the south end is divided up into offices for the mayor, city auditor, city tax collectors, city treasurer, water tax collector, superintendent of the waterworks, city recorder, and police headquarters. The third story of the building is the recorder's, or city police, courtroom. The north end of the city hall is of similar size as the other, but in the interior is differently constructed. It has but one stairway, which leads up from the northwest corner. The second story is occupied entirely, save the stairway lobby, by the assembly rooms of the Board of Aldermen and Councilmen. The third story is occupied by an organization known as the Improved Order of Red Men, as a council chamber or \"wigwam\".\n\nCity Hall, 1880\nThat venerable establishment, which serves the City of Nashville the double purpose of City Hall and Market House, is among the oldest\" and most unsightly of all our public institutions, A portion of the building was erected in 1827 or 1828. In 1855, it was remodeled and enlarged, and the addition of the city hall made to it; but the work, as intended, was never fully carried out, as it was proposed to build a public hall, extending over the entire market-place, and accessible from both the north and south ends. Some years ago an effort was made to remove this building, but the projectors were met by the stubborn fact that the General Assembly of North Carolina, in 1784, reserved four acres (the present Public Square) for public buildings, and the question has never been settled, whether the city could divert the space to other purposes. The writer is not a prophet, but he dares prophesy that ten years from now the demands of progressive civilization will have removed the market-place, and on the present site thereof, a� superb and creditable City Hall will be erected. Furthermore, that the \"Public Square\" \"will lose its primitive nomenclature, and be� known to the next generation as \"City Hall Square,\" or \"Court Square.\" The present building cost $55,000, .and on the first floor has 100 stalls. The upper stories contain the council chambers, and the offices of the municipal authorities.\n\nCity Hall, 1897\nNashville's City Hall, imposing three-story brick and stone building with tower, located on Public Square, completed. Planned since January 1896, when fire almost destroyed old building, construction progressed steadily during the past year. George Stainback, Bennet H. Beazley, and William T. Smith, recently elected chairman, Board of Public Works and Affairs, supervised construction. Mayor R.H. Dudley, members of Board of Public Works, and other officials occupy offices on second floor of City Hall, with first floor rental property and City Council Chambers on third floor.\n\n1897 Fire\nFIRE IN NASHVILLE. LARGE BUSINESS BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED LAST NIGHT. Flames That Started in a Dry Goods Store Burned Over an Area of a Block and a Half.\n\nNashville, Tenn., January 3d, 12:30 a. m. �Lebeck Brothers, wholesale and retail dry goods; Grimes, Daily and Robinson, dry goods dealers, and the public market, having an area of a block and a half, have been totally destroyed by fire, which started about 11 o�clock. The fire started in Lebeck Brothers�. Lebeck�s insurance is $100,000. It is impossible to give others in detail, but insurance men approximate it at $700,000. The falling of the south wall of the Burns building did more to check the flames than anything else, completely burying in brick and mortar the small houses, and making a gap that the fire could not jump on Market street where it looked as though by the aid of the wind a tremendous conflagration was in progress. Crushing walls and showers of flaming sparks added terror to the occasion. The marvellous thing about the disaster is that no fatalities occurred. Lebeck Brothers, in whose building the fire started, are extensive wholesale and retail dry goods merchants. The fire originated in the second story of Lebeck Brothers and spread westward. At 12:30 A. M. a terrific wind arose from the southwest which fanned the flames into a fury. The City Hall and market, which is located opposite the ruined buildings, caught from sparks and was very seriously damaged. Burns & Co., harness manufacturers, located on Market street in the rear of Lebeck Bros., caught at 12:15 and was totally ruined. The total loss at this hour is estimated at $1,000,000. Telegrams have been sent to Louisville, Memphis and Chattanooga for help and the tire has little signs of abatement. At 1:05 o�clock tlie rear walls of the Burns saddlery store fell through the jewelry store of B. H. Stenf & Co., crushing a number of people. Charles Thompson is the only one reported seriously injured.", "Alternate Image 1 File Name": "city-hall-and-market-house-2nd-ca1905.jpg", "Alternate Image 1 Image Type": "photo", "Year of Alternate Image 1": "ca 1905", "Use Alternate Image 1?": "yes", "Alternate Image 1 Usage Notes": "before 1928", "Alternate Image 1 Download Location": "Nashville Library", "Alternate Image 1 Credit at Download Location": null, "Alternate Image 1 Download URL": "https:\/\/cdm15769.contentdm.oclc.org\/digital\/collection\/nr\/id\/7759\/rec\/2", "Alternate Image 2 File Name": null, "Alternate Image 2 Image Type": null, "Year of Alternate Image 2": null, "Use Alternate Image 2?": null, "Alternate Image 2 Usage Notes": null, "Alternate Image 2 Download Location": null, "Alternate Image 2 Credit at Download Location": null, "Alternate Image 2 Download URL": null, "Description": "On January 2nd, 1897, the south end of the city hall and market house complex was damaged by a fire originating across the street in Lebeck Brothers' dry goods store.

The fort was a cross-shaped blockhouse with earthen parapets on three sides that contained artillery. \nThe elevation that made the hill a desirable location for a fort also made it a good location for the city's third reservoir, replacing the reservoir on Rolling Mill Hill. Construction of the reservoir began in 1886 and took three years to complete, obscuring all traces of the old fort. The walls are 34-feet high and can hold as much as 51 million gallons of water in two separate basins. Water was pumped from the Cumberland River into the western half of the reservoir, and silt was allowed to settle. The silt-free water then flowed into the eastern half, and from there was distributed to consumers.\nA little after midnight on November 5th, 1912, the same day Woodrow Wilson was elected president, a segment of the reservoir's southeastern wall gave way. Years of slow seepage had undermined a section of wall on the reservoir's southeastern side. Millions of gallons of water cascaded down the hill, pushing away tons of earth and rock fill and scouring a portion of the hill down to the bedrock. Houses were washed off their foundations, and people floated out of their houses still in their beds. Remarkably, no one was killed in the disaster. The repaired section of the reservoir wall, about 175 feet in length, can still be distinguished today." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 52.669608808382371, 38.68625199604071 ] } },

Craighead, believed to have been the first preacher to reside in Davidson County, lived in a log house on the property. About 10 years later he built a brick house a little to the north of the log house. In the 1830s the log home was enlarged, covered in clapboard and eventually named Evergreen Place. From 1981 until 1996 the house served as the Jim Reeves Museum. On September 22nd, 2005, a developer waited until after dark and bulldozed Evergreen Place despite its historic status to make room for a Home Depot.\nA stone church was built on Craighead's land and was used not just for his services but also as a school, Davidson Academy. The academy moved into the city in 1806, and was first renamed Cumberland College and later the University of Nashville.

Lewis (1784–1866) lived on the Fairfield property just off Lebanon Pike from 1813 until his passing in 1866. The smaller house or wing peaking out from behind the main structure may represent an earlier house. After Lewis's death the property passed to his son-in-law, the French ambassador to the US during the Jackson adminstration, who seems to have been living in France during this period. After his death in 1878 the house was sold at auction and passed through two more owners until it was purchased in 1886 to house City Hospital, then run by the Medical Department of the University of Nashville. The hospital departed for the much larger, purpose-built building on Rolling Mill Hill in 1890. The house became a Catholic hospital, St. Margaret's, for the next four years, and after that housed St. Bernard Academy for a year. The city acquired the old house in 1903 and had it demolished two years later so that Lipscomb School could be erected on the land. Sometime after 1960 Lipscomb School was torn down to make way for I-40 and the Hermitage Avenue off-ramp." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 57.723392086429044, 41.736815923834136 ] } },

At some point Shelby took to calling this house Fatherland.\nIn 1855 Shelby, at 70 years of age, began construction of another house, designed by Adolphus Heiman (1809–1862). It was built as a present to his daughter Priscilla and her husband John Phelan, and he named it Fatherland as well. At about the same time, the first Fatherland was demolished and the property subdivided.

He had by 1828 brought most of the congregation around to the new doctrine, and in that year a resolution was adopted nullifying the church's previous constitution and rules of order. Thus, the Baptist Church of Nashville became Spring Street Christian Church. \nThe opponents of Campbellism initially remained with the church but in 1830 left to form the First Baptist Church of Nashville. By 1841 they had built a Gothic Revival church on 5th Avenue North (pictured above), which served the congregation until it moved to Broad Street in 1886. The 5th Avenue North church was demolished in the 1950s and replaced by the Commerce Union Bank Building.

In the mid 1880s, the failure of the city to provide any schooling for Black children beyond the 8th grade spurred a campaign for a new high school. Parents showed up at the all-white high school asking that their children be enrolled but were turned away. Meetings were held and parents petitioned the school board for a high school for their children. Responding to pressure, in 1886 the school board set aside the second floor of the newly built Meigs school as the first African-American high school in Nashville. In March 1933 Meigs School was destroyed by a tornado. A new school building opened on the same site the following year." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 56.386720366908612, 47.364314923535666 ] } },

The high school students that formerly attended Hume School moved to the new building, with Hume retaining grades 1 through 8. Fogg High School was named for Francis Fogg (1795–1880), a prominent attorney and an early school board member.

The most impressive structure, Fort Negley, went to St. Cloud Hill.\nNashville, the logistics hub for US military operations west of the Appalachians, was critical to the Union effort and so became the most heavily fortified city in the country apart from Washington DC. Fort Negley, the biggest inland stone fortification constructed during the war, was a symbol of the importance attached to Nashville.\nApproximately 2700 laborers, mainly runaway slaves, built Fort Negley between September and December 1862. A quarter of the workers died during construction due to the harsh conditions. Fort Negley's artillery was used during the Battle of Nashville in 1864, but otherwise the fort played no role in the battle. \nInitially named for General James S. Negley (1826–1901), the fort was renamed Fort Harker in 1865 due to General Negley's questionable performance at the Battle of Chickamauga, but the new name never took hold. \nThe US Army abandoned the fort in September 1867, and after the army departed, the hill resumed its role as a popular picnic spot for Nashvillians. During Reconstruction the fort was also the site of Ku Klux Klan meetings.\nBy the 1930s the fort had deteriorated badly. The Works Progress Adminstration (WPA) financed the restoration of the fort, which reopened in 1938. After the WPA restoration, little effort was made at further upkeep and the fort again decayed. The WPA's replica stockade was torn down in the 1960s, and the fort was closed to the public. Beginning in 2002 the fort was again restored, this time by the City of Nashville, and reopened to the public in 2004." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 53.819744536773094, 40.035147039599401 ] } },

The brewery underwent a series of ownership and name changes before being bought by Moerlein Brewing of Cincinnati in 1890. Moerlein razed the brewery they had purchased and built the much larger facility shown above. In 1893 William Gerst (1847–1933), who had moved to Nashville from Cincinnati to supervise production for Moerlein, bought his employer's interest in the companyand renamed the company the William Gerst Brewing Company. During Prohibition the company changed its name to the Gerst Bottling Works and survived by producing nonalcoholic beverages and Orange Crush. Beer production resumed when Prohibition ended, but competition from national brands drove Gerst out of business in 1954. The brewery complex was demolished and replaced by a warehouse in 1963." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 53.858167466816489, 41.300030172650089 ] } },

They lived in a two-story blockhouse built by the previous owner to resist Indian attacks. Jackson began farming  at the Hermitage with nine slaves, a number that grew to 110 by the time of his death in 1845. \nIn 1819 the Jacksons began building a grander, two-story Federal-style residence in a location on the property chosen by Rachel. The blocks for the limestone foundation were quarried on the plantation, and the bricks were made on-site from clay dug out of a nearby field. In 1831, after Rachel's death and during Jackson's first presidential term, the house was enlarged by adding one-story wings to each side of the original structure and a one-story portico with 10 columns. A chimney fire three years later did severe damage to the house, gutting the interior. For the rebuilt Hermitage, Jackson chose to replicate the 1831 structure but added a two-story Greek revival style portico to its front. It was finished in 1836, shortly before the end of his second term.\nWhen Jackson died in 1845, his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr. (1808–1865), inherited the plantation, but financial reversals forced him to sell it to the State of Tennessee in 1856. Over the next 33 years, a number of uses were considered for the property, including a southern branch of the West Point military academy. Finally, in 1889 the state handed the house and 25 acres over to the Ladies' Hermitage Association, a group founded to preserve the  house and grounds." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 83.157053374494566, 56.173993133297991 ] } },

During a year-long tour of Europe in 1873 and 1874, the group raised $50,000, enough to build Jubilee Hall. Jubilee Hall was not only the first building on Fisk's new campus, but the first permanent building in the US erected to provide college-level education to African-Americans.

The May family sold the factory in 1983, and it was closed two years later. " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 54.911938837385989, 39.649916688073908 ] } },

Its president, Philip Lindsley (1786–1855), resigned the same year. At about the same time and possibly related to the closure of the school, 3rd Avenue South was extended and the main building of the university, Cumberland Hall, which had stood directily in the path of the street, was demolished. \nIn preparation for the reopening of the school, a new building, called the Stone Building and later the Chapel Building, was erected in 1853 on a 30-acre plot two blocks south of the old campus. Prior to that time the only building on the land had been the chancellor's residence. The following year the university's merger with the Western Military Institute necessitated a dormitory to house the students, so the building pictured above was built. This dormitory was called Lindsley Hall during its existence, but at some point in the early 20th century it was razed and the Chapel Building took the name Lindsley Hall." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 55.090502938222357, 42.332903610233814 ] } },

When a new main post office was opened near the airport in 1986, the building on Broadway became a branch location. In 1996 Thomas Frist (1938–) of the Frist Foundation proposed that the old post office be used as an art museum. The city of Nashville purchased the building from the USPS in 1999, and in partnership with the foundation, converted the old post office into the Frist Center for the Visual Arts (now the Frist Art Museum), which opened in 2001." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 52.131098373756075, 42.979282893375391 ] } },

The world's only full-size replica of the Greek Parthenon was created for the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition as the physical expression of the nickname. Intended to last only as long as the fair, the building's exterior surfaces were made of plaster. Once the decision was made not to demolish the building at the end of the exposition, maintenance of the deteriorating plaster became an ongoing problem. Finally, in 1920 reconstruction of the building began, using reinforced concrete for the load-bearing structure and cast concrete aggregate for the exterior surfaces. The 1897 interior had been designed as a gallery space and so was not historically accurate, but the rebuilt Parthenon was designed to be an accurate replica inside and out. Exterior work was completed in 1925; the interior was completed in 1931. One missing element was the statue of Athena Parthenos that dominated the interior of the ancient Greek Parthenon. A donation box sat inside the Parthenon for many years, and by the early 1980s the fund had grown large enough for work on Athena to begin. Sculptor Alan Lequire (1955–) was selected to do the work, and the 42-foot, 12-ton cement Athena was unveiled in 1990. Further donations paid for the statue to be painted and gilded, work that was completed in 2002. " }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 46.605957070243036, 41.059896123245828 ] } },

The institution was planned by the Ministers' Alliance of Nashville and in 1924 had a bed capacity of 210. During the Depression, this Hospital merged with Baptist Hospital which then operated a hospital at Eighth Avenue and Union Street. The merged hospital went into receivership during the Depression but emerged as the modern day Baptist Hospital campus after World War II. \n\nThe original 80-bed hospital consisted of the Murphy house, with two three-story additions. In 1924, a new building was constructed, expanding the hospital�s bedcount to 210. In 1948, Protestant Hospital became Mid-State Baptist Hospital and was placed under the control of the Tennessee Baptist Convention. \nProtestant Hospital opened 1919 in two buildings on a 10-acre block on Church Street.

Murphy (?-1900), who had made his fortune selling whiskey, bought two parcels of land bounded by Church Street, Patterson Street, 20th Avenue and 21st Avenue. He built an Italianate mansion on his tree-covered estate, where he lived until his death in 1900. In 1911 Buford College bought the property from Murphy's heirs and constructed a large brick building with two wings, the West Building, to serve as a school building. Buford College adopted the name Nashville College for Young Women (NCYW) around this time. \nThings must not have gone to plan for NCYW because the school lost the property to foreclosure. The promoters of a new hospital, Protestant Hospital, purchased the 10-acre plot in November 1918, with the hospital opening in March 1919. The mansion was used as a dormitory for the school of nursing, while the hospital filled the West Building. The hospital endured repeated financial difficulties during the first three decades of its existence, leading to the Tennessee Baptist Convention assuming control in 1948. At that time the hospital took the name Mid-State Baptist Hospital, changing it again to Baptist Hospital in 1964. In 1967 the West Building was razed to make space for a new 300-bed wing of the hospital." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 48.63388242757388, 42.125095633581807 ] } },

The Ryman Auditorium opened as the Union Gospel Tabernacle in May 1892. Ryman and Jones intended the auditorium to be primarily a venue for religious revivals, especially Jones's, but it hosted other types of events from the beginning. At first there was no balcony - the balcony was added in 1897 to accommodate a reunion of Confederate veterans that coincided with the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. There was also no stage, just a pulpit and a small platform. In 1901 the stage was added to facilitate a performance of 'The Barber of Seville' by the Metropolitan Opera. The Grand Ole Opry moved to the auditorium in 1943 and stayed for 30 years before leaving for suburban Pennington Bend. After the Opry's planned move was made public, the owner, radio station WSM, announced its intention to demolish the building. Efforts by local residents, politicians, and preservationists prevented demolition, but the Ryman sat largely unused and deteriorating for 20 years. New owners began efforts to repair and restore the building in 1989. Major additions and improvements were also made in 1994 and 2015.

Finally in 1843 the legislators selected Nashville as the permanent state capital and Cedar Knob, the highest point inside the city limits at the time, as the site of the capitol building. William Strickland (1788–1854) of Philadelphia designed the building, and construction lasted from 1845 to 1859. Slave, convict and commercial labor were all used in construction. \nStrickland chose to top the structure with a replica of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, making Tennessee's capitol one of 13 state capitols without a dome. The legislature met for the first time in the building in 1853 while it was still being built. During their occupation of Nashville, the Union Army fortified the hilltop structure and designated it Fort Johnson, after military governor and future president Andrew Johnson.

In 1885 Nashville acquired its first professional baseball team, and the city built a grandstand in the same field. In 1894 an exhibition game between the Nashville Tigers and the New Orleans Pelicans was played at night, the first ever night baseball game in Nashville. In 1890 the ballpark was renamed AthletIc Park. In 1908 sportswriter Grantland Rice (1880–1954) began referring to it as Sulphur Springs Dell, which he later shortened to Sulphur Dell, and that name was eventually adopted by the ballpark. \n\nNumerous additions and improvements were made to the facility over the years, but one problem persisted. The grandstands had been built along the north and east sides of the park and home plate faced southwest. This orientation forced batters to look into the afternoon sun. At the conclusion of the 1926 season, the ballpark was demolished and rotated 180°, allowing batters to stand with their backs to the sun. This new layout exposed a steep incline, especially in right field, that had formerly been covered by the bleachers and the grandstand. Thereafter right fielders playing in Sulphur Dell were nicknamed mountain goats. The lighting was upgraded in 1931, allowing the first non-exhibition night games to be played at the field.\n\nTeams that played at Sulphur Dell include:\n\n•  Nashville Americans (1885–1886)\n•  Nashville Blues (1887)\n•  Nashville Tigers (1893–1894)\n•  Nashville Seraphs (1895)\n•  Nashville Centennials (1897)\n•  Nashville Vols (1901–1961, 1963)\n•  Nashville Standard Giants\/Elite Giants (1920–1928)\n•  Nashville Stars (1942, 1950–1951)\n•  Nashville Black Vols\/Cubs (1945–1951)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 51.777772432834546, 46.436315709764813 ] } },

Sometime after his 1850 retirement, he built this mansion on Rolling Mill Hill. In 1853 the state erected a building for the Tennessee School for the Blind directly across Hermitage Avenue from Claiborne's mansion. During the Civil War the school had been used as a hospital and was badly damaged by a fire. In 1873 Claiborne's house was offered for sale and was bought by John M. Lea (1818–1903), a lawyer, judge, and former mayor of Nashville. He immediately donated it to the School for the Blind, which was still in need of a permanent building. The school remained in the old Claiborne mansion until 1952 when it moved to its current home on Stewarts Ferry Pike." }, "geometry": null },

The Louisville & Nashville Railroad was chartered in 1850 by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and was based in Louisville. The railroads were competitors before, during, and after the Civil War, but in 1880 the L&N executed a hostile acquisition of the NC&StL. Anger in Nashville at the takeover of the hometown NC&StL was sufficient that the L&N let its new acquisition continue as an independent subsidiary for the next 77 years. \nBy the 1880s both railroads were outgrowing their depots in Nashville. In 1898 the city of Nashville, the NC&StL and the L&N entered into an agreement that allowed the railroads to build a new depot at Broadway and 10th Avenue. Called Union Station because it was used by two railroads and so, in a sense, represented the union of their rail networks, the new train station opened in 1900. The NC&StL and the L&N used their clout to prevent the upstart Tennessee Central from using Union Station. The Tennessee Central made do with a separate depot near the foot of the Shelby Street Bridge.\nIn 1955 freight traffic was moved to Radnor Yards, and two years later the NC&StL and L&N officially merged, closing the NC&StL offices in Nashville. Passenger trains between Florida and Chicago, one each way per day, continued to use the depot until 1979, when 120 years of passenger rail ended in Nashville. After sitting vacant for a few years, the station was restored and reopened as a hotel in 1986." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 51.927297290910538, 42.866640755342374 ] } },
